## üöÄ What is Crypto Insights Terminal?

**Crypto Insights Terminal** is a web application that provides a comprehensive suite of data analysis tools for the cryptocurrency market. The dashboard automatically updates its data every day, ensuring you always have the latest information to identify trends, analyze historical performance, and discover new investment opportunities.

This project was built with the goal of offering a high-quality user experience, replicating the feel of a professional trading terminal while remaining accessible to everyone.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture & Automated Workflow

The system is engineered with two primary components that work in synergy:

### 1. **Automated Data Collection (Backend)**
*   **Data Source:** Daily API calls are made to the public **[CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)** to fetch a complete market snapshot.
*   **Process:** A Python script (`actualizar_datos.py`) is executed automatically every 24 hours by a **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** workflow.
*   **Storage:** The data collected each day is **appended** to the `historico_criptos.csv` file. This file acts as a simple, evolving database, accumulating a rich historical record over time.

### 2. **Interactive Visualization (Frontend)**
*   **Framework:** The user interface is built with **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**, enabling rapid development and a rich, interactive user experience.
*   **Data Reading:** The application (`app.py`), deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud, reads the `historico_criptos.csv` file directly from the repository.
*   **Live Updates:** Since the app is linked to the GitHub repo, every time the GitHub Actions workflow pushes an updated CSV, Streamlit automatically reboots the application, loading and displaying the freshest data.

## ‚ú® Core Features

The `app.py` application processes the entire historical dataset to offer the following analysis tools:

*   üìà **Market Summary:** Get a 360¬∞ view of the market's current state with global metrics, a unique Market Flow diagnosis, and daily Top 10 movers.
*   üî¨ **Segment Analysis:** Visually compare the behavior of different crypto asset groups (Titans, Active Altcoins, Low-Liquidity Gems) to identify trends and risks.
*   üîç **Asset Explorer:** Dive deep into specific cryptocurrencies. Analyze historical price evolution, compare key metrics against other assets, and apply technical indicators like SMAs.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Market Screener:** A powerful tool to filter the entire market based on your custom criteria, including Market Cap, 24h Volume, and Performance.
